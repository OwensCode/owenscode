      <description>I spent some time yesterday installing Apache Airflow in a Docker container, using an image based on the amazonlinux image provided by Amazon. The end goal is to run it in an EC2 instance, but while I was waiting for the ops team to create one for me, I decided to experiment with setting it up in Docker. Using the amazonlinux image should give me a similar environment to what I can expect on the EC2.</description>

      <description>Today I learned that there are a lot of static site generators out there. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently something that has gained a lot of interest. I&amp;rsquo;m mainly interested in generating my content from Markdown files, so at least that gave me somewhere to start when narrowing down the list to try. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in static site generation after my experience with a Movable Type blog I had at some point, which could publish static html content and as a result loaded really fast.</description>
