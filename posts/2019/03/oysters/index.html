    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I chaperoned a school field trip to an aquarium this week, and one of the
things we learned is that oysters filter the water they live in. Full grown
oysters can actually filter up to 50 gallons per day. That is pretty amazing
for such a small creature. In addition to the nutrients they consume in the
form of microscopic species, they also remove algae, dirt and some types of
pollution from the water. As you can imagine, this is pretty important for the
whole ecosystem; more important than I expected. It&rsquo;s also important to know
this when you&rsquo;re purchasing oysters for eating; you don&rsquo;t want to be eating an
oyster that&rsquo;s been absorbing pollutants from the water it&rsquo;s been living in, so
make sure you buy oysters from a clean water source.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s this got to do with technology and coding computer programs? Not much
really, but it occurred to me how important it is to have a healthy ecosystem
for our code to live in so that it can thrive. Producing good quality code is
about more than just the actual code itself. It&rsquo;s even more than the tools that
the software developer uses to write and debug the code. A good development
environment, like the developer&rsquo;s preferred editor or IDE, is important, and
debugging tools make a developer&rsquo;s life easier, but don&rsquo;t forget the tools and
processes that help to keep bad and buggy code at bay: automated tests (whether
you follow a full-blown TDD methodology or not quite), static analysis tools,
linters, source control systems, peer review systems, continuous integration
and deployment environments, and I almost forgot to include some of the core
components: programming languages, shared libraries, and application
frameworks, and all the rigorous documentation that makes these tools usable.
You can probably add some more to my list.</p>

<p>I think the Open Source community contributes a huge amount to this ecosystem.
There are so many tools and libraries available through open source projects,
and very importantly the source code is available, which helps to encourage an
evolving and diverse system of resources for the system to sustain itself and
grow from.  In addition, it raises the standard for closed source and
commercial systems. Why would I buy software from you if I can get something as
good or better for free. You have to provide some kind of advantage to offset
the direct financial cost, whether it&rsquo;s even better software, paid support,
consulting services, training, or something that differentiates you from your
open source competitors.</p>

<p>All of this contributes to a diverse ecosystem that I enjoy working in. Even
the sharks are beneficial to the system as a whole.</p>
