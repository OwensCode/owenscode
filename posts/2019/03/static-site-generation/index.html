    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Today I learned that there are a lot of static site generators out there. It&rsquo;s
apparently something that has gained a lot of interest. I&rsquo;m mainly interested
in generating my content from
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> files, so at least
that gave me somewhere to start when narrowing down the list to try. I&rsquo;m
interested in static site generation after my experience with a <a href="https://www.movabletype.org/">Movable
Type</a> blog I had at some point, which could
publish static html content and as a result loaded really fast.</p>

<p>My reason for wanting Markdown support is that I want something simple that
allows me to just focus on text and not the html. I&rsquo;m a programmer and I used
to do a lot of web development, but that&rsquo;s not really what this blog is about.
I want to write text, not code, unless I&rsquo;m writing about code, which Markdown
should give me good support for.</p>

<p>I ended up starting out with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, but it looks like it
should be relatively easy to move to something else if I want to, mainly
because of the content being in Markdown, and because many of these tools use
similar directory structures for the basic content.</p>

<p>Reasons for trying Hugo:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s Open Source with an Apache 2.0 license</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy to install because it&rsquo;s written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and I
can install it via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> without having to install any
other dependencies like Ruby or Node. I have a habit of getting things like
that setup nicely with rvm or nvm and then forgetting what I used when I come
back to them a few months later. Hopefully I won&rsquo;t have that problem with Hugo.</li>
<li>It looks reasonably mature and well supported with an active community, and
has some nice features like draft posts.</li>
<li>Nice choice of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a> and I wanted to at least
start out with a default theme so I can get up and writing pretty quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other options I looked at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://docpad.org/">DocPad</a> - looks interesting and could be the next one I
try, if I try anything else. Not as well known as some of the other
contenders, but still seems active on Github. Looks like I would need to do
more work on the theming though. Also needs Node, which adds just a little more
local complexity.</li>
<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> - another top contender that looks slick and
is well supported. Used by Github for generating Github pages. Needs Ruby.</li>
<li><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> - themes look slick, but maybe a little
heavyweight for something I want to just self-host on my laptop when creating
content. Another one that needs Node.</li>
<li><a href="https://postach.io/">Postach.io</a> - an interesting idea that turns an
Evernote notebook into a blog or website. Appealing in that I could start a
post from almost anywhere, like my iPad or work computer (if I have an idea to
start on at work), but I&rsquo;m really hesitant to start this on a closed platform
like Evernote, and sometimes I have disagreements on formatting with Evernote, with
no real way to get to the underlying source.</li>
<li><a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> - I didn&rsquo;t get around to looking too
closely at this one, but it&rsquo;s here as an option if I ever decide to try
something else out. Another Ruby based tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have to admit that I didn&rsquo;t look too closely at most of these. This is just a
side interest for me, not a work project where I have to justify my choices and
make sure I&rsquo;ve covered all my bases.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for my first post. Hopefully there will be many more.</p>
